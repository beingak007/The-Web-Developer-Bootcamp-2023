Section-7: The World of CSS Selectors
=>CSS Rule- Everthing you do in CSS follows this basic pattern.

Selector{
    property : value;
}

70. Universal & Element Selectors
1. Univarsal Selector - It selects everything in document.

eg:
*{
    color:black;
}

2. Element Selector - It selects everything of given type.

eg:
Selects all images
img{
    width=100px;
    height=200px;
}

p {
    color:black;

}

button{
    background-color:rgb(238, 255, 0);
}


=>Styling multiple elements similarly at a time.
->Select all h1's and h2' at a time
eg-1:
h1,h2{
    color:magenta;
}

eg-2:
h1, p{
    color:rgb(0, 0, 255);
}

71. The ID Selector - The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
               or
The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element's id attribute. 

->In order style one thing differently using ID selector.
-># is part of syntax

syntax:
#selector{
    property:value
}

->only one thing on the page should have any given id.
->every id should only use once.
->Avoid using them in code.

->Add id to particular elements by using id="".
->style it using id selctor.




eg-1: 
Select the element with id of 'logout'

#logout{
    color: orange;
    height:200px;
}

->check coolors.co

eg-2:

=>.html code
<button id="register">Register</button>


=>.css code
#register{
    background-color: blue;
}


72. The Class Selector 
->The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute.
->class selector is most commonly used element selector.
->class is applied to multiple elements.
->it is creating class of elements.
->group of elements are styled similarly.
->styling group of different or same elements similarly.

Syntax:
.Selector{
    property:value;
}

-> "." is part of syntax.

eg-1:
-> .html file
<span class="tag">type of gait</span>
<span class="tag">contrast to walking</span>
<span class="tag">over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.</span>

-> .css file
.tag {
    background-color: lightpink;
    color: rgb(40, 2, 255);
    font-size: 20px;
}

73. The Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

Syntax:
selector1 selector2 {
  /* property declarations */
}


eg-1: 
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

eg-2:
->this selects all the achor tags which are descendants or nested of li.
->select all <a>'s that are nested inside an <li>
li a{
    color:teal;
}

eg-3:
Selects all <a>'s tags which are nested inside span and span which is nested inside paragraph.
p span a{
    color:rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

eg-4:
section span a{
    color:white;
    background-color: rgb(106, 0, 255);
}




CSS Code
footer > a{
     color:rgb(0, 255, 13);
}

74 Adjacent selector and Direct Child
74.1
Select only the paragraphs that are immediately by an <h1>

eg-1:
h1+p{
    color:red;
}

=>html code
<input type="text" id="search" placeholder="search">
<button id="login">login</button>
<button id="signup">sign up</button>

=>css code
input+button{
   background-color: blueviolet;
}

73.2 Direct Child
Select only the <li>'s that are direct children of a 
<div> element.

->anchor tag nested inside footer
footer a{

}

->anchor tag direct descendant
footer>a{

}

eg:
=>html code
<footer>
    <a href="search">hello</a>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Vel, deleniti.</p>

      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. <a href="search">hello</a> Deserunt, sapiente. Saepe quas natus quibusdam libero sint porro nisi officiis exercitationem.</p>
</footer>

75. Attribute Selector

->select all input elements where the type attribute is set to "text".
eg-1:
input[type="text"]{
    width:300px;
    color:yellow;
}

eg-2:
=>html code
<input type="password" placeholder="password" for="password">

=>Css code
input[type="password"]{
    color:blue;
}


76. Pseudo Classes
Keywords added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements(s).

:active
:checked
:first
:first-child
:hover
:not()
:nth-child()
:nth-of-type();

eg-1: :hover
a:hover{
    color:red;
}

->when we hover over links the color of the links changes to red.
->sometime some hover may not work on them due to css 
specifity.

eg-2: :active
button:active{
    background-color: palegreen;
    color:rebeccapurple;
}

->when button is clicked it turns to pale green.

eg-3: ::nth-of-type()
The :nth-of-type() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position among siblings of the same type (tag name).

->selecting every even paragraph and styling them.
p:nth-of-type(2n){
    background-color: coral;
}

77. Pseudo Elements
Keyword added to a selector that lets you style a particular part of selected elements(s).
::after
::before
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection

->we use two semi-colon(::) to indicate pseudo element.

->we can slect first line, first letter etc.

1. ::first-letter
->stling font size of first letter in the paragraph.
p::first-letter{
    font-size: 20px;
    
}

2.::selection
->When paragraph is selected it gives aqua.
p::selection{
    background-color: aqua;
}

78. The Cascade
The order your styles are declared in and linked to matters.

eg-1:
h1{
    color:red;
}

h2{
    color:purple;
}

->Purple wins

->Css follows order.

79. CSS Specificity
what happens when conflicting styles target the same elements?
-> Specificity how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to same element.
->it is measure of how specific a given selector is.The more specific selctor wins.

->id>class>element
->id is extremely specific.

eg: 2nd one is more specific
->Element Selector
p{
    color:yellow;
}

->Element Selector + Element Selector 
selection p{
    color:teal;
}

-> Formula for Specificity

eg-1: 
section p{
    color:teal;
}

 
    0                0                        2
ID Selectors       class,                   Element and
                   Attribute&               Pseudo-element selectors
                  pseudo-class  
                   selectors              
                  
eg-2: specificity-100
#submit{
    color:olive;
}


    1                0                        0
ID Selectors       class,                   Element and
                   Attribute&               Pseudo-element selectors
                  pseudo-class  
                   selectors    




eg-3: specificity ->  12
nav p.active{
    color:olive;
}


    0                1                        2
ID Selectors       class,                   Element and
                   Attribute&               Pseudo-element selectors
                  pseudo-class  
                   selectors   

->Specificity calculator
https://specificity.keegan.st/ 

80-Tip: Chrome dev tools and css
inspect ->you can see details under styles.
->we change styles and preview them from inspect.
->after refreshing everythings goes normal.
->we can also see specificity details.


81. Inline Styles and important exception
->Inline styles are more specific than ID's, Classes and Elements.
->that's the reason it is not recommeneded to use inline styles.

eg:
<style>
        h2{
            color:blue;
        }
        h1{
            color:red;
        }
</style>

81.1 important exception
->telling browser that this is more specific.
->the most specific possible thing.
eg-1:
h1{
    color:red !important;
}

->generally it is not recommended to use it.
->they can be used if we are working on somes project.

82. CSS Inheritance
->Some css properties will be inherited by child elements if they are not set on the element specifically.

eg-1:
body{
    color:rgb(111, 0, 255);
}

->All elements in the body inherit this property.
->see addition information for element in mdn documentation.
