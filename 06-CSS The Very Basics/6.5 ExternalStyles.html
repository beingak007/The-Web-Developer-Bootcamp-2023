    <h1>Tennis</h1>
    <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two
        teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a
        hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game
        is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is
        unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
