61. Including Styles Correctly
=>Options to write styles
1. Inline Styles
->writing styles directly inline on each element.
->it is not a good idea most of the times.
->we cannot style all elements at time. style can be done individually.

eg:
 <h1 style="color:rgb(4, 247, 28)">Hello World</h1>
    <button style="background-color:palegreen">I am Button</button>
    <button style="background-color:rgb(60, 255, 0)">I am Button</button>

2. The <STYLE> Element
->writing styles inside of a <style> element. 
->this is easy.
->but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents.
->Not recommended either.
->if there are multiple documents in project then style element has to copy in each document.
->it is quiet complex.

eg:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Style Element</title>
    <style>
        h2{
        color:rgb(0, 179, 255);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    
</body>
</html>

3. External Style Sheets
->Writing your styles in a .css files and then include using <link> in the head of your html document.
->it is recommended.

->rel attribute
The required rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document/resource.

->href attribute
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
->specify .css file name.

=>Linking .html file and .css file 
<head>


<head>
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="6.6 ExternalStyles.css">
</head>

->Link tag always goes in head they  are meta information.

62. Color & Background-Color Properties
selector{
    property : value;
}

1. color property
The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value.

->color property change the text color.

eg: 
1. Make all <h1> elements greenyellow
h1{
    color:greenyellow;
}

2. Change background color
button{
    background-color: aqua;
}

63. Colors Systems: RGB & Named Colors
->refer HTML Color Codes Website -https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
->we have 140 named colors.
->A typical computer can display 16,000,000 different colors.

=>Color Systems
1. RGB color Systems
->Red, Green, Blue Channels
->each channel ranges from 0-255

->these colors added together to form other color.
->refer pixel geomentry.
->it is an example of additive color system.

red -rgb(255,0,0) -> reg, green, blue
blue-rgb(0,0,255)

eg:
button{
    color:rgb(255,0,0);
    background-color: aqua;
}

->Use color picker for selecting color.
->htmlcolorcodes.com



2. Hexadecimal Color System
->still red, green and blue channels.
->Each ranges from 0-255 but represented with hexadecimal.
->it is base 16.
->every slot in a number we have 16 choice
-> _ _ _ _
->Hexadecimal - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
A- 10
B- 12
C- 13
D- 14
E- 15
F- 16

->numbers are given bunch of colors.
->we use letters to make numbers shorter.
->Hexadecimal is used to store more information to store single digit.
->#ffff00 - Yellow color 

->#      ff              ff               00
->   Red channel      Green Channel    Blue channel
->     255               255              00 
-> it gives yellow.

->#  -> Indicates hexadecimal color
->ff -> In Hexadecimal is 255
->ff -> 15*(16^1)+15*(16^0)=255

->generally use hexadecimal codes.

->#000000 = #000
->#cc55ee = #c5e

eg:
h1{
    color:#cc55ee;
    or
    color:#cc55ee;
}

->HSL (for hue, saturation, lightness) and HSV are alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers.



65. A Reminder On Semicolons & CSS
->it is essential.
->madatory to wrte Semicolons in css.

->if semicolons are missing in code the property will not work.
